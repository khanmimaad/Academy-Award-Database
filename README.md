# AcademyAwardDatabase


Description:

An iOS application that serves as a database for the complete history of every Academy Award winner in each category.  The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences

Proposed Goals:
Educate moviegoers on well-rounded picks of the most rewarding films around the world for the last 95 years.
Make the application easily accessible to anyone interested, preferably on the app store.
Provide a native iOS experience developed using Swift and the Xcode IDE.

Information on films developed with IMAX Corporation and various technologies peaks the interest of mentioned companies and their products (Dolby, ARRI, ILM, etc.)

Agile development and proper documentation paired with native Swift technologies such as protocol extensions, interval matching, and now Dynamic Island integration.

A pre-existing history allows for completion of a database that compiles all Oscar winners and nominees. Easily completed within the time frame required.


Current Progress as of Milestone 3: Updated UI and information with even more additional features to be delivered soon:
